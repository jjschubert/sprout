# Sprout
Sprout is a task management application that helps gardeners grow bountiful vegetable plants from seed.

Sprout makes it easy to manage different timelines for each plant as you guide it through various stages, from starting seeds to caring for a new seedling to preparing it for the elements to finally planting it outdoors. Plan and track important milestones for each plant and easily view overdue and upcoming tasks.
